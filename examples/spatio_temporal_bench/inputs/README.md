# Spatio-temporal model used as benchmark for the Eurohack24
-   Spatial discretization: ns = 4002 (diagonal blocksize)
-   Temporal discretization: nt = 250 (number of diagonal blocks)
-   Number of fixed effects: nb = 6 (arrowhead blocksize)

Using a gaussian likelihood and gaussian prior hyperparameters.
